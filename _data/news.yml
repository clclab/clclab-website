    We have a paper accepted at [ISMIR2021](https://ismir2021.ismir.net) where we introduce a new
    representation for melodic contour: [_cosine contours_](github.com/bacor/cosine-contours).
    The representation is motivated by an interesting observation:
    the principal components of melodies are shaped as cosines.

    We won a best paper award for the best multi/interdisciplinary 
    research at [ISMIR2020](https://www.ismir2020.net/awards/) for our paper on
    [mode classification in plainchant](https://github.com/bacor/ISMIR2020).

    [We presented a paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3424911.3425514) 
    at [DLfM 2020](https://dlfm.web.ox.ac.uk/7th-international-conference-digital-libraries-musicology)
    where we introduce [Chant21](https://github.com/bacor/chant21), 
    a Python library for working with plainchant in music21,
    and two large datasets, [CantusCorpus](https://github.com/bacor/cantuscorpus)
    and [GregoBaseCorpus](https://github.com/bacor/cantuscorpus).
    In the paper we also discuss two case studies on the melodic
    arch hypothesis and, essentially, melodic predictability in 
    parts of chants known as _differentiae_.
