Nice that you are trying to reach us! We receive a lot of email and messages through other channels, and are unfortunately not able to respond to all of them. Apologies for this! To make sure, as best we can, that important messages still reach us, or that you still receive the information you need, here are a few courses of action:

* If you **work at ILLC**, often the best way to contact Jelle and other CLClab members is through Slack.
* If you have access to Jelle's **online calendar booking page**, and have already agreed to meet, you can reserve a meeting slot in his calendar directly.
* If you are contacting us to inquire about **possibilities to do a PhD** or research internship under supervision of one of the CLClab members, please note that there are unfortunately no possibilities at the moment. My university has no summer internship program, and all vacancies for PhD positions are advertised on our institute’s website: www.illc.uva.nl. We apologize for not being able to reply to each email!
* If you are a **student** in one of our courses, please check the course manual about ways to contact TA’s and the lecturers before emailing.
* From September 2025, we will organize regular **online office hours** that you can join to discuss issues that are covered by the points above;
* If you really need to reach Jelle (Willem) urgently, you can use try his personal account at mailbox.org, with user ‘zuidema’. (Better not use the zoho-account anymore).
