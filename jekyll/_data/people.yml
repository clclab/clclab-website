     Willem Zuidema (a.k.a. Jelle) is associate professor of Computational Linguistics and
     Cognitive Science at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)
     of the University of Amsterdam and research fellow of the national Language In
     Interaction consortium. Before joining ILLC in 2004, he worked at the University of Edinburgh
     (2002-2004), where he completed his PhD thesis on “The Major Transitions in the
     Evolution of Language”. He also worked at Sony Computer Science Laboratory - Paris (2000),
     the AI lab of the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels, (2000-2002), and in the Behavioural
     Biology group at Leiden University (2007-2008).

    The topic of my PhD is centered around the fields of NLP, interpretability, and linguistics.
    I am interested in gaining a better understanding of the current successes of the state of the art in NLP.
    My research is guided by hypotheses derived from linguistics, that I evaluate on deep neural models using techniques from the field of Explainable AI.

    Despite the differences between artificial and biological neural networks,
    she hopes that investigating how artificial systems encode linguistic processes
    can help understanding how language is implemented in the brain.

    Why do humans make music, and how do they do it? Why are we a musical species? 
    These are the questions that motivate my research. I use computational methods 
    to study how musical traditions differ. Mapping the diversity of musics across 
    the globe, is a key step in understanding the cultural evolution of musics.
