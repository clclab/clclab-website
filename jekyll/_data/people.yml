    I am assistant professor in cognitive science and computational 
    linguistics at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation. 
    I do research on these topics, coordinate the Cognition, Language 
    and Computation lab and supervise several PhD and MSc students there. 
    I teach in the interdisciplinary masterâ€™s programs Brain & 
    Cognitive Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, and Logic, and coordinate 
    the Cognitive Science track in the MBCS. I sometimes give public talks 
    on human language, animal communication and evolution. asdfasdfasdf.

    Currently, in my PhD work, I focus on (artificial) neural network models 
    for (semantic) parsing, a problem that for me touches on the core of 
    understanding natural language. Although artificial neural networks 
    are of course nothing like the real brain, I hope that understanding 
    the principles by which they can encode processes can still teach us 
    something that will lead to a better understanding of how language 
    could be implemented in the brain.

    My general research interest is Cognitive Modeling. I am interested 
    in working on deep neural models that are biologically plausible and 
    can perform at a human level. I have chosen Language as the higher 
    cognitive function that I am going to focus on because I think much 
    of human intelligence is reflected in language.

    I'm interested in neural networks and deep learning. My current work is to 
    employ them to solve natural language processing tasks such as entity linking, 
    coreference resolution, and dependency parsing.  I'm also interested in formal 
    semantics, especially learning semantic parsing, which is the topic of my master thesis.
