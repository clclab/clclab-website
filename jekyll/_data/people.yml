     is an assistant professor in Cognitive Science and Computational Linguistics
     at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) of the University
     of Amsterdam. Before joining the Institute in 2008(?), he worked in the Behavioural
     Biology group at Leiden University (2007-2008), and at the University of Edinburgh 
     (2002-2004), where he completed his PhD thesis on “The Major Transitions in the 
     Evolution of Language”.

    has a background in Physics, Logic and Computational Linguistics.
    In her PhD she works with artificial neural network models for semantic parsing. 
    Despite the differences between artificial and biological neural networks, 
    she hopes that investigating how artificial systems encode linguistic processes 
    can help understanding how language is implemented in the brain.

    obtained her Master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Tehran.
    Her main interest lies in the field of Cognitive Modeling. During her PhD, 
    she investigates biologically plausible neural network models which simulate
    how humans learn and develop language.
