abstract = {Language acquisition is a special kind of learning problem because the outcome of learning of one generation is the input for the next. That makes it possible for languages to adapt to the particularitiesof the learner. In this paper, I show that this type of languae cange has important consequences for models of the evolution and acquisition of syntax.},
