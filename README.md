# Website of the CLC Lab

## Setup
This is a static website generated by Jekyll. To change the contents you have to edit markdown (or sometimes YAML files). Jekyll builds a website based on that in the `site` directory. That's the directory served to visitors.

The user interface has some dependencies, most importantly Bootstrap, and some JS libraries such as JQuery. We use Yarn (or npm) to manage those packages, and webpack to pack them all together in one big JS file (bundle.js) which are dumped in `jekyll/assets/` and then used by Jekyll. Similarly, we use webpack to process the SASS stylesheets and dump them in `jekyll/assets/`. All styling and scripting files for the front-end can be found in the `webpack` directory. The templates are in `jekyll/layouts` as usual.


## Installation
For **deployment** install (Jekyll)[https://jekyllrb.com/] and hit `jekyll serve`.

For **development** (i.e., if you want to change the styles or scripts) you need to install (node)[https://nodejs.org/en/] and (yarn)[https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/]. Then run `yarn install` in the main directory to install all dependencies. After that, you can start developing! Run `yarn build` to turn process the styles and scripts (and dump them in `jekyll/assest`). Run `yarn watch` to do this whenever a file in `webpack/` gets updated.
